# React Native beginner roadmap

Welcome to the React Native Beginner Roadmap repository! ðŸš€ This project aims to provide a comprehensive roadmap for beginners diving into React Native development. Whether you're a seasoned developer exploring mobile app development or a complete newcomer to programming, this roadmap will guide you through the essential concepts, tools, and practices needed to build React Native applications.

# Introduction

    React Native is a popular open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It allows developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React. React Native is based on React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it allows developers to write mobile applications that are indistinguishable from those written in Java or Swift.

    This roadmap is designed to guide beginners through the essential concepts, tools, and practices needed to build React Native applications. It covers the core concepts of React Native, state management, navigation, networking, data persistence, testing, deployment, performance, and security.

# Prerequisites

    Before you start learning React Native, you should have a good understanding of JavaScript, React, and the basics of mobile app development. If you're new to programming, you should start by learning the basics of JavaScript and React before diving into React Native.

# Getting Started With Expo

    To get started with React Native, you'll need to set up your development environment. The easiest way to get started with React Native is to use Expo, a set of tools and services for building React Native applications. Expo provides a set of tools for building, deploying, and testing React Native applications, and it allows you to get started with React Native without having to set up a development environment.

    To get started with Expo, you'll need to install the Expo CLI, create a new project, and start the development server. You can then use the Expo client app to run your application on your mobile device, or you can use the Expo web interface to run your application in the browser. I am attaching a link to the official documentation of Expo for more information. [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/)

# Expo Mobile App

    The Expo client app allows you to run your React Native application on your mobile device. You can use the Expo client app to run your application on iOS or Android, and you can use it to test your application on different devices and screen sizes. The Expo client app also provides a set of tools for debugging and testing your application, and it allows you to share your application with others by scanning a QR code.

# Internet Connection and Expo

    The Expo client app requires an internet connection to run your React Native application. When you run your application using the Expo client app, your application is loaded from the Expo servers, and any changes you make to your application are automatically updated on your mobile device. If you don't have an internet connection, you won't be able to run your application using the Expo client app. You can use the Expo web interface to run your application in the browser if you don't have an internet connection.

    First of all, you need to install the Expo client app on your mobile device. You can download the Expo client app from the App Store or Google Play Store. Once you have installed the Expo client app, you have to make sure that your mobile device internet is as same as on your laptop.

    --> Then Goes to your Internet setting on laptop.
    --> Click on the connected network.
    --> Click on properties.
    --> There is two options showing "Private" and "Public".
    --> Click on "Private" and turn on the sharing option.
    --> Then go to the Expo client app and scan the QR code.

# Conclusion

    In future updates, I will be adding more content to this roadmap. I will be adding more sections like state management, navigation, networking, data persistence, testing, deployment, performance, and security. I will also be adding more resources and links to help you learn more about React Native. I hope this roadmap will help you get started with React Native and build your first mobile application. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me. I would love to hear from you! ðŸš€
